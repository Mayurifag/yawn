**Writing Git commit messages makes you yawn?** ðŸ¥± Here is a tool that will stage/commit/push for you!

---

## Why Yawn?

In its most basic form, you make changes, run `yawn`, and boom â€“ your code is staged (if needed), committed with AI-generated message, and pushed. All in one go!

But "simple" doesn't mean "limited". Under the hood, `yawn` is **super customizable**:

*   Tweak the AI prompt or use different Gemini model? âœ…
*   Automatically stage changes, commit and push? âœ…
*   Override defaults using environment variables or additional parameters? âœ…
*   Override config per project? âœ…
*   Avoid Gemini API limits? âœ…
*   Sensible defaults? âœ…
*   Need to push skipping Git hooks (`git push --no-verify`)? You may even force push, if you want. âœ…

It **really** adapts to your workflow, that's why I made it and why it is better
than any other Git commit message generator I've tried.

## Installation

Requires Go 1.24+. Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH`.

Run: `go install github.com/Mayurifag/yawn/cmd/yawn@latest`

There are also pre-compiled binaries in packages, yet I am too lazy to write
instructions to install them in Windows, MacOS and Linux. Yeah, those `curl`
ones.

Pro-tip: `alias q="yawn"` is very useful, add it after first tries + config
adaptations and your workflow will be changed forever. ðŸ˜‰

---

## Customization

Want to tweak things? `yawn` is flexible!

*   **See all options:** Run `yawn --generate-config` to see a commented default configuration file (`.yawn.toml`).
*   **Common tweaks:**
    *   `gemini_model`: Use a different Gemini model.
    *   `prompt`: Rewrite the instructions for the AI.
    *   `ask_stage`: Set to `false` to never stage automatically.
    *   `auto_push`: Set to `true` to always push after commit.
    *   `push_command`: Change how `yawn` pushes (e.g., `git push --no-verify origin HEAD`).

Place your customizations in `./.yawn.toml` (project-specific) or `~/.config/yawn/config.toml` (global), or use `YAWN_*` environment variables.

By default, `yawn` generates commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, which provides a standardized format for commit messages. This makes your commit history more readable and enables automated tools to parse your commit messages.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add PrintInfo for situations when staged changes. Also yawn has to print info about stage/push automatically due to configs
* [ ] Release 1.0.0 when it will be mature enough
* [ ] Make installation easier for all OSes (i.e. homebrew installation) and README.md better
* [ ] In final result give link to user's PR or project page. Make that for github, gitlab (also private ones)
* [x] Wait and add more free AI API providers, who dont ask for credit card
  * I don't know anyone for now, but will add more here probably
* [ ] Replace EstimateTokenCount implementation in internal/gemini/client.go with calls to c.client.CountTokens(ctx, modelName, genai.Text(text))
* [ ] Remove verbose mode
* [ ] Dockerfile -> release it -> add alias to README.md

Actually, I do not plan much features. Project considered as done.
