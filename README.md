**Writing Git commit messages makes you yawn?** ü•± Here is a tool that will stage/commit/push for you with a single yolo push button!

---

## Why Yawn?

`yawn` is designed for speed and simplicity. In its most basic form, you make changes, run `yawn`, and boom ‚Äì your code is staged (if needed), committed with a smart AI-generated message, and optionally pushed. All in one go!

But "simple" doesn't mean "limited". Under the hood, `yawn` is **super customizable**:

*   Tweak the AI prompt? ‚úÖ
*   Want to automatically stage *all* changes? ‚úÖ
*   Ignore specific files in the diff for the AI besides the .gitignore? ‚úÖ
*   Override defaults using environment variables or additional parameters? ‚úÖ
*   Override config per project? ‚úÖ
*   Avoid Gemini API limits? ‚úÖ
*   Interactive? ‚úÖ
*   Sensible defaults? ‚úÖ
*   Change the Gemini model? ‚úÖ
*   Need to push skipping Git hooks (`git push --no-verify`)? ‚úÖ Yea, you may even force push, if you want.

It **really** adapts to your workflow, that's why I made it and why it is better than any other Git commit message generator I've tried.

## üöÄ Installation

Requires Go 1.24+. Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH`.

Run: `go install github.com/Mayurifag/yawn/cmd/yawn@latest`

There are also pre-compiled binaries in packages, yet I am too lazy to write instructions to install them in Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Pro-tip: `alias q="yawn"` is very useful, add it after first tries + config adaptations and your workflow will be changed forever. üòâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Want to tweak things? `yawn` is flexible!

*   **See all options:** Run `yawn --generate-config` to see a commented default configuration file (`.yawn.toml`).
*   **Common tweaks:**
    *   `gemini_model`: Use a different Gemini model.
    *   `prompt`: Rewrite the instructions for the AI.
    *   `ask_stage`: Set to `false` to never stage automatically.
    *   `auto_push`: Set to `true` to always push after commit.
    *   `push_command`: Change how `yawn` pushes (e.g., `git push --no-verify origin HEAD`).
    *   `ignore_patterns`: List file patterns (`*.log`, `*.tmp`) to exclude from the diff sent to the AI.

Place your customizations in `./.yawn.toml` (project-specific) or `~/.config/yawn/config.toml` (global), or use `YAWN_*` environment variables.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Release 1.0.0 when it will be mature enough
* [ ] Make installation easier for all OSes (i.e. homebrew installation) and README.md better

Actually, I do not plan any more features, except adding free AI API providers except of Gemini. Project considered as done.
