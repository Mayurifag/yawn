**Writing Git commit messages makes you yawn?** ðŸ¥± Here is a tool that will stage/commit/push for you!

---

## Why Yawn?

In its most basic form, you make changes, run `yawn`, and boom â€“ your code is staged (if needed), committed with AI-generated message, and pushed. All in one go!

But "simple" doesn't mean "limited". Under the hood, `yawn` is **super customizable**:

*   Tweak the AI prompt or use different Gemini model? âœ…
*   Automatically stage changes, commit and push? âœ…
*   Override defaults using environment variables or additional parameters? âœ…
*   Override config per project? âœ…
*   Avoid Gemini API limits? âœ…
*   Sensible defaults? âœ…
*   Need to push skipping Git hooks (`git push --no-verify`)? You may even force push, if you want. âœ…

It **really** adapts to your workflow, that's why I made it and why it is better
than any other Git commit message generator I've tried.

## Installation

Requires Go 1.24+. Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH`.

Run: `go install github.com/Mayurifag/yawn/cmd/yawn@latest`

There are also pre-compiled binaries in packages, yet I am too lazy to write
instructions to install them in Windows, MacOS and Linux. Yeah, those `curl`
ones.

Pro-tip: `alias q="yawn"` is very useful, add it after first tries + config
adaptations and your workflow will be changed forever. ðŸ˜‰

---

## Customization

Want to tweak things? `yawn` is flexible!

*   **See all options:** Run `yawn --generate-config` to see a commented default configuration file (`.yawn.toml`).
*   **Common tweaks:**
    *   `gemini_model`: Use a different Gemini model.
    *   `prompt`: Rewrite the instructions for the AI.
    *   `ask_stage`: Set to `false` to never stage automatically.
    *   `auto_push`: Set to `true` to always push after commit.
    *   `push_command`: Change how `yawn` pushes (e.g., `git push --no-verify origin HEAD`).
    *   `wait_for_ssh_keys`: Set to `true` to make yawn wait until SSH keys are available via `ssh-add -l` before pushing. Useful for workflows involving tools like KeePassXC where the agent might not have keys immediately. Defaults to `false`.

Place your customizations in `./.yawn.toml` (project-specific) or `~/.config/yawn/config.toml` (global), or use `YAWN_*` environment variables.

By default, `yawn` generates commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, which provides a standardized format for commit messages. This makes your commit history more readable and enables automated tools to parse your commit messages.

## Roadmap

* Update deps
* Ignore binary files in diff, just show them. Maybe too much tokens files as well.
* If got timeout from Gemini API, tell user probably need to update models. Any way to get the recent ones from Gemini API?
* Lets send all codebase to Gemini API so answer will be more accurate. I should also make message for sent message that if we have little feature change and a lot of logging removal, main message has to be about feature change.
* 10 second timeout for Gemini API call is not enough for large diffs. Lets make it 30 seconds.
* Check if there is a way to output not full commit message but rather token by token in console.
* Remove verbose mode - it is not needed and complicates code
* Add feature to send to fallback model if current model is down for a while (happens with new models)
* Think of better config handling. Current solution is complex. Though I also need source of config, koanf seems missing this functionality. Plus better init file handling. I need to write custom provider for those. Maybe koanf rewrite with custom provider.
* git pull before commit
* git push force with lease confirmation if already there is commit in origin. [y/N]. Also show 3 latest commits from origin in such case with authors.
* If commited manually something and accidently type `q` after â€” that means user wants to push, lets do it for him - on agreement (enter)
* Rewrite README.md
* Make installation easier for all OSes (i.e. homebrew installation) and README.md better
* Release 1.0.0 when it will be mature enough
* Change release process makefile command
